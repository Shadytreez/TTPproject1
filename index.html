            How does the earth need saving you ask? Well, it turns out that due to greenhouse gases increasing every year, our earth is being damaged. “Now why is that such a big issue?” you may be asking. Well ever since due to climate change, the average temperature has risen all over the world. Which has many effects on our environment. Since the average temperature has doubled the number of large fires between 1984 and 2015 in the western United States.  Ice caps are melting which causes animals like walrus and polar bears to lose their home. It also raises our sea level which can cause floods to people who live near water.

            Now what can you do to help global warming? One way that everyone can help to reduce greenhouse gases is to eat less meat. Livestock produces about 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gases. Another way to help is to drive less and walk more. If you have the money, get some solar panels for your roof. It will reduce the greenhouse gases while also saving you money in the long run. You can also consider donating to these foundations. The money you donate will go to helping our earth and make a better place for the future generations to come.
